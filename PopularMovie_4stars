Q. Find popular movies (> 4 star ratings)

PIG Template:

ratings = LOAD '/user/maria_dev/MovieData/u.data' AS (userID:int, movieID:int, rating:int, ratingTime:int);

metadata = LOAD '/user/maria_dev/MovieData/u.item' USING PigStorage('|')
	AS (movieID:int, movieTitle:chararray, releaseDate:chararray, videoRealese:chararray, imdblink:chararray);
   
movieNameList = FOREACH metadata GENERATE movieID, movieTitle,
	ToUnixTime(ToDate(releaseDate, 'dd-MMM-yyyy')) AS releaseTime;
   
groupRatingsByMovie = GROUP ratings BY movieID;

AverageRatings = FOREACH groupRatingsByMovie GENERATE group as movieID, AVG(ratings.rating) as avgRating;

fiveStarMovies = FILTER AverageRatings BY avgRating > 4.0;

fiveStarsWithData = JOIN fiveStarMovies BY movieID, movieNameList BY movieID;

oldestFiveStarMovies = ORDER fiveStarsWithData BY movieNameList::releaseTime;

DUMP oldestFiveStarMovies;
